# range-using-measured-beat-frequencies
% complete the TODOs to calculate the range in meters of four targets with 
% respective measured beat frequencies [0 MHz, 1.1 MHz, 13 MHz, 24 MHz].


% Note : The sweep time can be computed based on the time needed for 
% the signal to travel the maximum range. 
% In general, for an FMCW radar system, the sweep time should be at 
% least 5 to 6 times the round trip time. This example uses a factor of 5.5

% Tchirp = (5.5 *2 * Rmax) / c ​
% Dres​= c / (2 * Bsweep)
% R = 2 * Bsweep​cTs​fb​​
% speed of light, c = 3*10^8 m/s^2
% range resolution, Dres = 1 m
% radar maximum range, Rmax = 300 m
% chirp bandwidth, Bsweep
% Print your answer using the disp function.

% TODO : Find the Bsweep of chirp for 1 m resolution
c = 3*10^8;
Rmax = 300;
Dres = 1;
Bsweep = c / (2 * Dres);

% TODO : Calculate the chirp time based on the Radar's Max Range
Tchirp = (5.5 *2 * Rmax) / c;

% TODO : define the frequency shifts 
Fb = [0 , 1.1 , 13 , 24 ]*10^6;
calculated_range = (c*Tchirp*Fb)/(2*Bsweep);
